# The EpicQA Dataset

## Introduction:
This project is based on Mahabharata and generated by GPT-4o using prompts.

>Prompts: You are a well-versed reader of this book and an expert in the field of question-answer dataset generation. Based on the following content, please generate 10 questions suitable for a question-answer dataset. The context and the question should be as concise as possible, and both the context and question must include the key information from the provided content. For these 10 questions, generate the corresponding question-answer pairs, including the context, question, correct answer, and incorrect answer. Return the results in dictionary form, with the dictionary keys being "context", "question", "right_answer", and "wrong_answer". For a example:


>Example: { "context": "Drona protected the Kaurava Vahinis for five days.", "question": "For how many days did Drona protect the Kaurava Vahinis?", "right_answer": "Five days.", "wrong_answer": "Ten days." }
